Crowding simulation of a polymer solution - Measure a polymer’s end-end length fluctuations in a dilute and concentrated solution. (NB R<sub>ee</sub> = √<R<sub>ee</sub><sup>2</sup>> here) and this is the value that is in the dmpchs and dmpcas files.
Choose a suitable length for the polymer and the box size (using your experience from the in-class simulations of the phantom chain), make it hydrophilic and find the equilibrated end-to-end length. Then increase the number of polymers and repeat. Keep increasing the density of polymers until you get an interesting curve for the <Ree> versus concentration (what does interesting mean here?)
  
  NB. For efficiency, each member of a group can simulate a different density and you can share the
results.

  Output: Time series of the end-to-end length of the single and concentrated polymers showing
they are equilibrated. Plots of log(R<sub>ee</sub>) against log(N) and extraction of the slope for a single
polymer and a few higher concentrations showing the effects of the crowding.
